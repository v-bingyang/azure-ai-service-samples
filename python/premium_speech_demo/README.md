## Prerequisites
- Install a version of [Python from 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

## Configuration

### Predefined Phrases for Correction
The system supports fixing predefined phrases. The example below shows a predefined set of phrases:

```python

```
You can modify this list in the `rewrite_content` function to include phrases specific to your use case.

### Azure OpenAI Model
The script uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model. You can modify this in the `rewrite_content` function to use a different Azure OpenAI model.
